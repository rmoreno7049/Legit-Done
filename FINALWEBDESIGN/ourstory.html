			<h1>Welcome! Thanks for checking out our page. I hope you find everything to be enjoyable, if not for my webdesigning skills, at least for my doggos!</h1>
			<h2><br>Mission</h2>
			-My goal is to get these adorable pups into a safe and loving home environment. What better time to introduce my dogs to the world than the holiday season!?
			<br><br>-They have suffered some unfortunate lives, and they want to be surrounded by love during the holidays, just like us!

			<h2><br><br>Food for Thought</h2>
			-Dogs are scientifically proven to improve your mood!
			<br>-Dogs are adorable!
			<br>-Adopting a dog helps combat the awful environment that we find in puppy mills and other animal abusing areas:(
			<br>-Every adoption fee is put into taking more dogs out of kill shelters and more dogs off the streets!
			<br>-A lot of dogs are surrendered by their owners and left to fend for themeslves because of various illnesses. Our donations go towards helping these dogs rehabiliate and live the best lives they can!
			<br>-Our dogs are all spayed/neutured because overpopulation leads to stray and neglected dogs, as well as risks for doggy health complications.
			<br>-We are a nonprofit organization and we are solely based off of volunteer work and donations
			<br>-Every dog that has been adopted from our home, has made a positive impact on the family and none have been returned to us!
			<br>-Lastly, Santa knows who is naughty and nice. Adopting a dog in need puts you on the nice list!
